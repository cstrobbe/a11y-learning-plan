# Accessibility Learning Plan for Developers

## Purpose

This learning plan is designed to provide web developers who are accessibility beginners with a plan and actionable goals for the journey of learning. It provides focus and a timeline rather than aimlessly searching tutorials. I've copied the format from [Anton Ball's Typescript Learning Plan](https://medium.com/@antonball/planning-to-learn-225fc7817394).

### What's a learning plan?

Wikipedia does a great job of defining what a [learning plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_plan) is. And Sarah Drasner wrote a great article at CSS Tricks about how she uses them: [Learning To Learn](https://css-tricks.com/learning-to-learn/).

## Goal

The goal of the learning plan is not to teach accessibility but provide the plan and resources in order to learn. The plan has a clear stopping point - the scope is basic accessible web development skills. This plan does not cover app development, which uses different code and techniques, although the underlying principles are the same. 

When you've completed the plan, you will be able to create basic accessible content and make a well-informed choice when reviewing more advanced plugins and tools which claim to be accessible. 

## Prerequisites

A basic understanding of front-end web development is assumed.

## Resources

These resources will be useful in this learning plan. There are many others which you may prefer. Suggestions welcome!

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility is a property of all websites, web apps or software apps. Some are more accessible than others. 

"Being accessible is about making your website, with all of its data and functions, available for anyone, no matter how they have to use your website." - Katie Cunningham, Accessibility Handbook (Oâ€™Reilly)

-   [What we mean when we talk about accessibility](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-accessibility-2/) by Alastair Duggin for Gov.UK
-   [Google's Web Fundamentals: Accessibility Overview](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/)
-   [Web Accessibility Initiative at W3C: Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)

## Learning Plan

Times are wild guesstimates based on how long it would take me to do all the tasks. If you're enjoying an activity, take as long as you want to experiment with it. If you need to break it down into smaller chunks, try doing the reading in one session and the activity in the next.

				</ul>
				<p>Activity: (I'm assuming your page is already repsonsive - if not, take another half hour to edit and test it). Add focus styles to any links or buttons. Use a contrast ratio tool to check the page and make fixes if needed. Add <kbd>body {filter : grayscale(100%);}</kbd> to the CSS to check if you have relied on colour alone for any visual indicators, and fix any problems.</p>

				<p>Quick testing is useful to confirm that the information you want to convey to all users is actually available to all users.
